# Concurrency in C# Cookbook

This part of the compendium is dedicated to highlight the best practices of asynchronous programming in C#.
The structure of the samples is a direct mapping of the great book [Concurrency in C# Cookbook](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/concurrency-in-c/9781492054498/)
written by [Stephen Cleary](https://stephencleary.com/) and published by O'Reilly.
