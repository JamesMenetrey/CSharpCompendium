# Concurrency in C# Cookbook

This section of the compendium is designed to showcase the best practices in asynchronous programming within C#.

Over the years, C# has evolved to incorporate a multitude of asynchronous execution patterns, with the `async`/`await` 
pair gaining great attention.
This section details the use and inner workings of this pattern, also known as the *task asynchronous programming model*
(TAP).

The sample structure mirrors of the great book 
[Concurrency in C# Cookbook](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/concurrency-in-c/9781492054498/)
authored by [Stephen Cleary](https://stephencleary.com/) and published by O'Reilly.
